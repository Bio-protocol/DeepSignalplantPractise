In Step8, because the sample data is too small for bin calculation and visualization, we provide the preprocessed data from Pore-C as the input. Download the files from the "Step8_Input" folder in Google Drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14xw6gvQz_gjUi6p86NrSHZq59YABlzZO?usp=sharing) and move it here.
